I had never been outside the country at this point and I half-jokingly asked them to convince their parents to let me tag along. They actually did ask and their parents said yes I was surprised and thrilled. I had to pay for all my own travel expenses and such but they would let me stay with them and feed me when we didn't eat out. We were there for 34 days and we also went to Tokyo, Japan for 5 days. These are the better pictures below and a short journal entry for each day's activities."

Our first stop was LA, which took about 4 hours but with the time zones it took it down to about 1 hour on paper (9:00 am KC to 10:30 am LA), then left LA on a bigger plane that would take us to Taiwan at 4pm. The flight from LA to Taiwan was 13 hours but again time zone changes made it much less and we landed around 8:30 pm the next day (time zones are weird) just as the sun was setting.",

This time I tried some new fruit called guava and pitaya (also called dragon fruit), both are delicious. You can get these in the states but nothing compares to getting it local and fresh since they have to pick them early to ship them, they just don’t compare. After breakfast we head up the hill to a local park/temple and got a beautiful view of Keelung. We rested a while and then headed down the coast to Fulong Beach for the concert. The stage was set on a huge sand barge and there were hundreds of people. My friend's aunt doesn’t let me fully get in and swim because it’s typhoon season but I still got in up to my waist and had a great time at the concert before we headed home for the night.",

Both the brothers got a bit cut and styled, with one even getting red dye while I try and see what dark hair looks like on me. They don’t let me get black so I went with dark brown (it did not look that good but at the time I thought it was cool, should have taken the hint from the stylist).

We detoured to see the brother’s dad’s old house but kinda got lost on the way and it ended up taking a few hours.

It was amazing with so many fish, penguins, dolphins, sharks, manta rays and stuff to see. While there I tried some dried squid, it was salty and reminded me of jerky.

There is a ferris wheel on the roof that we went on and the view was spectacular. After walking around the mall for a while we did some sightseeing around the city and ended up on a ferry tour around the harbor of Glory Pier. We walked around the beach some when we got back and ended up in the Central Park metro taking the train back to Formosa Boulevard Station which is a beautiful site itself and the roof is a huge wonderful mural.

This time we would be going east toward the sun and the day should feel really short but with all the time zone changes and the 12ish hour flight back we somehow left at 4pm 8/10 from Taipei and landed at 2pm 8/10 in LA. No idea how that works but it was confusing and like time travel since we went through so many time zones. I think one of the zones is the day limit over the ocean so technically when you pass through it's the next day. Which would explain the flight leaving 7/09 at 4pm and landing on 7/10 at 8pm. Still weird and causes major jet lag. We then had a flight from 5pm LA to 6pm Phoenix AR and were supposed to go to KC the same day but got held up and had to stay the night in Phoenix. I was mad because my bathing suit was in my check bag so I couldn't even use the pool/hot tub in the hotel they booked us in.",
