I had never been outside the country at this point and I half-jokingly asked them to convince their parents to let me tag along. When they actually did ask and their parents said yes I was surprised and thrilled. I had to pay for all my own travel expenses and such but they would let me stay with them and feed me when we ate at their house. We were there for 34 days and we also went to Tokyo, Japan for 5 days. These are the better pictures below and a short journal entry for each day's activities."

Our first stop was LA ,which took about 4 hours but with the time zones it took it down to about 1 hour on paper (9:00 am KC to 10:30 am LA), then left LA on a bigger plane that would take us to Taiwan at 4pm. The flight from LA to Taiwan was 13 hours but again time zone changes made it much less and we landed around 8:30 pm the next day (time zones are weird) just as the sun was setting.",

This time I tried some new fruit called guava and pitaya (also called dragon fruit), both are delicious. You can get these in the states but nothing compares to local and fresh since they have to pick them early to ship them, they just don’t compare. After breakfast we head up the hill to a local park/temple and get a beautiful view of Keelung. We rested a while and then headed down the coast to Fulong Beach for the concert. The stage is set on a huge sand barge and there are hundreds of people. My friend's aunt doesn’t let me swim because it’s typhoon season but I still play in the water and have a great time at the concert before we head home for the night.",

Both the brothers get a bit cut and styled with one even getting red dye while I try and see what dark hair looks like on me, they don’t let me get black so I go with dark brown (it did not look that good but at the time I thought it was cool, should have taken the hint from the stylist). We then meet up with my friend's aunt at her work and try to chat in English with some of their coworkers' daughters to help them practice. We head home after that.",

We made a bank visit while on the way to get more cash and went to a NT$39 store, a 39 taiwan dollar store which is like a dollar store in the states, and got some souvenirs. Once at the tower we head up to the top of the roof on the 91st floor but only get to see half the roof since it's windy and still typhoon season. It was the most amazing view and I could see all the way to the mountains. We stay till sun down and go to a bookstore on the way back home and pass out after a long day.",
